*The* recommended mechanism for generating and maintaining your Cyclades installations as it enables a configurable and reproducible 
(operationally maintainable) artifact from the specifics of this workspace.

== Basic Features

This is a deployment and configuration control mechanism for a Cyclades installation. This mechanism is highly recommended
for generating and maintaining your Cyclades installations as it enables a configurable and reproducible (operationally maintainable) artifact
from the specifics of this workspace. Downloading and building this template workspace will generate a Cyclades installation with all of the
current Cyclades SOA Nyxlets included by default. Use this as a template to create tailored Cyclades deployments for variable requirements
...i.e. different environments, different service pools etc...

* Provides a reproducible mechanism for generating deployments
    ** Nyxlets/Services 
        *** Nyxlet selection
        *** Versions
        *** Configurations
    ** Cyclades Service Engine 
        *** Core and shared library selection
        *** Core and shared library versions
        *** Configurations
    ** J2EE configurations (i.e. database pools, JNDI configurations etc...)
* Provided template builds and packages the default Cyclades complete installation (war file generated)
* Simply duplicate and modify this provided template for custom deployments

== Overview

This document describes the steps involved for deploying a complete Cyclades default installation using the Cyclades SOA deployment build and packaging mechanism. Please follow the instructions below.

== Generate And Deploy The Complete Cyclades SOA Default Distribution

. Install Gradle (if you do not already have it): http://www.gradle.org

. Install Tomcat (if you do not already have it): http://tomcat.apache.org (We're running on Tomcat 7) This could be a standard installation on any host, local or remote

. Download and install (extract) a stable version of this repository to a directory of choice (example: "/cycladessoa")
	.. https://github.com/cycladessoa/cyclades-deployment/archive/master.zip (We'll assume the extracted directory is "/cycladessoa/cyclades-deployment" for our purposes)

. From within the directory "/cycladessoa/cyclades-deployment" run the command _gradle clean build_

. The Cyclades Service Engine binary distribution exists within the _build/libs_ directory after a successful build (_build/libs/cyclades.war_). Simply copy this file to your Tomcat installation's "webapps" directory and be sure to preserve the name "cyclades.war".

. Restart Tomcat and verify the installation
	.. http://localhost:8080/cyclades (Core Cyclades Service Engine status page should be displayed without error)
	.. http://localhost:8080/cyclades?action=help (Help page displays without error)

[NOTE]
You can also use the build system to install the Cyclades Service Engine (if the "Tomcat Manager" is running and passwords are setup correctly)
by running _gradle installCyclades_ (see "gradle.properties" for settings with respect to this feature)

[NOTE]
There is no authentication mechanism turned on by default for the auth, exec and script_engine Nyxlets with this installation. Simply add the property "password" in the properties file for the Nyxlets that you wish to enforce simple authentication (i.e. add the property entry "password=myPassword" in the file exec.properties in the nyxlets directory to enable simple password protection for the exec Nyxlet).

== Adding And Removing Nyxlets/Services From Your Distribution

Simply add or remove *nyxlets* entries from the _dependecies_ closure/section of your _build.gradle_ file prior to building:

nyxlets group: 'com.github.cycladessoa.nyxlets', name: 'r',             version: '1.0.0.1',  transitive: false
----

[NOTE]
You can make properties accessible to your Nyxlets by placing a file named after your Nyxlet with the _.properties_ suffix in the
_src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/nyxlets_ directory. The Cyclades Service Engine will look for this file and automatically load and make 
the properties available to your Nyxlet if present. You will notice this distribution includes some by default...like _restfs.properties_,
 for example.
